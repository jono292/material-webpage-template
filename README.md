# Material Webpage Template

A closed-source website template I designed for personal use, but I have decided to release this simple layout, which can be used to create responsive websites. This is a work in progress, and not all code is ready for open source, hence the empty sections and ugly styling for some components.

# How to use

It is recommended that you use the stable version, which has been checked for bugs.
While it is relatively safe to use the master version, there may be bugs that we haven't found yet.
If you are interested in using our CSS components, you can head to the releases to download a minified version
of the latest stable build.

# Unfinished features (TODO)

Many features are complete, but the code isn't ready for an open source release. A few of the features that will
be coming soon are:

* Buttons
* Input Boxes
* Animations

# Contributing

We are more than happy for you to contribute something, but please make sure it has been tested and does
not cause any issues. Right now, we are more looking people who can patch up the bugs, not introduce new features.
If we do believe a feature that has been contributed meets our standards, it may be released.
