# Material Webpage Template

A closed-source website template I designed for personal use, but I have decided to release this simple layout, which can be used to create responsive websites. This is a work in progress, and not all code is ready for open source, hence the empty sections and ugly styling for some components.

# Unfinished features (TODO)

Many features are complete, but the code isn't ready for an open source release. A few of the features that will
be coming soon are:

-Buttons
-Input Boxes
-Animations
