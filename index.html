<p>

This template is a work in progress layout for many sites I have made, and since it's
pretty nice, I decided to release it to GitHub. I am slowly pushing more code out, as some is still
very messy and hard to read, so some parts are unfinished. You may find some very ugly looking css elements, including
input boxes, buttons etc, they will be fixed in a future release.
